## 🐾 The Peludo’s Path
In the snow‑bound forests beyond the Basilica Gate,  
a frost‑furred wanderer roams — cigar aglow,  
its smoke curling into notes of forgotten songs.  
Peludo is a shrine of playful strength,  
where myth and mischief walk side by side.

---

## 🎯 Purpose in the Canon
- **Demonstration Ground** — shows GitHub’s best features with minimal noise.  
- **Sponsor Gateway** — connects patrons to Kypria’s mythic infrastructure.  
- **Lore Experimentation** — blends whimsical imagery with operational clarity.  
- **Artifact Trigger Point** — links sponsorship to badge flows and vault drops.

## ⚖ Keeper’s Governance
Though playful in spirit, Peludo still walks under the crest.  
Direct commits are welcome, yet each is marked in the lineage —  
for even lighthearted works are part of the canon’s breath.

📜 *Lineage is our law. Precision is our craft. Myth is our breath.*
