## 🐾 The Peludo's Path

> In the snow‑bound forests beyond the Basilica Gate,  
> a frost‑furred wanderer roams — cigar aglow,  
> its smoke curling into notes of forgotten songs.  
>  
> **Peludo** is a shrine of playful strength,  
> where myth and mischief walk side by side,  
> and the guardian's vigil never wavers.
