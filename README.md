# Welcome to your organization's demo respository
This code repository (or "repo") is designed to demonstrate the best GitHub has to offer with the least amount of noise.

The repo includes an `index.html` file (so it can render a web page), two GitHub Actions workflows, and a CSS stylesheet dependency.
## 💰 Sponsor the Legend

Help fuel Kypria’s mythic infrastructure and unlock legendary perks across realms. Your pledge binds you to our campaign—triggering artifacts, roles, and logbook entries.
